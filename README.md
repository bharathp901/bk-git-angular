# Emailapp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

# Additional Comments
I am sharing my solution for the offline task provided to me. 

The solution provides a very high level design of the task allowing the user to login to an email with credentials and able to access the messages in the inbox, sent or trash folders. Each functionality is split into independent components allowing scalability to add more features with smooth execution.

More featutres - 
Add api's to process realtime data using the api calls
Use more functionalities of UI styling for better and user friendly UI.

below are the reason's for not adding more features - 
1) Time constraint, considering the amount of time i could spend and avoid delay in response sharing my first commit data. 
2) In my previous experience i have used more .css styling and need to look into in depth related to .scss styling to play around with it.

Thank you!
